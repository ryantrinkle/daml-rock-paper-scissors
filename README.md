# Project Ideas App
Daml templates designed for a platform for proposing project ideas to get rejected/approved.

### I. Overview 
This project was created by using the `empty-skeleton` template. The project adopts and exemplifies the `proposal-accept` design pattern. A signatory can create a ProjectIdea contract. Then they can exercise the Propose choice as a controller to get the project proposal either approved or rejected by their manager. If the manager, a controller, exercises Reject choice on the proposed contract, the employee can exercise Revise choice on it to re-propose the project with updated details. Upon manager exercising Accept choice, a Project contract is created.

### II. Workflow
1. An employee creates a ProjectIdea contract. Both colleague and manager are invited as obeservers, but manager, as a controller, is authorized to exercise either Reject or Accept choices.
2. Upon the controller exercising Reject, a new contract is created.
3. Revise choice can be exercised on the newly generated contract from above.
4. Accept choice is exercised to finalize the project idea and generate a new Project contract.

### III. Challenge(s)
* `controller ... can` syntax causes warning in Daml 2.0+. The code itself does not cause any issues/errors in 2.5.0 but according to the warning, the syntax will be deprecated in the future versions of Daml. More information [here](https://docs.daml.com/daml/reference/choices.html#daml-ref-controller-can-deprecation).
* The new controller syntax requires a controller to be an observer first before they can exercise a choice, otherwise it'll throw an error: "Attempt to fetch or exercise a contract not visible to the committer." For more information, check out [this post](https://discuss.daml.com/t/error-attempt-to-fetch-or-exercise-a-contract-not-visible-to-the-committer/1304/1) on the Daml Forum.
* The project was created by using `empty-skeleton` and the following was removed from `daml.yaml`:
```
sandbox-options:
   - --wall-clock-time
```
and replaced with the following:

```
exposed-modules:
  - Main
navigator-options:
 - --feature-user-management=false
```
